# Repository Title [version number]
===================================
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/phpunit/phpunit/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/phpunit/phpunit)

This is where you describe your project in short. This will be where potential users look to understand what your project is about -- and it's your chance to catch their eye. 

This specific project is an MSP430G2553 based game console. It was built for a conference and that's pretty much all I feel like writing about it because this is just an example, after all. It's a good idea to put some sort of picture of your completed project here like this -- but smaller:

Requirements and Materials
============

This is where you talk about what sort of libraries are required and what sort of hardware is needed:

Software:
* arduino-example-library
* gcc-c++

Bill of Materials:
* 4 x push buttons
* 12 x green LEDs
* 1 x 4.7k resistor
* 4 x 100 ohm resistor
* 1 x slide switch
* 1 x battery holder
* 1 x breadboard
* 1 x MSP4302553

Build Instructions
==================

Here is where you give specific instructions about how the device is built. The more detail the better -- especially if your build is very complicated. Here you should include schematics of your build:

And a breadboard view is also a good idea. So we'll throw one in here as well.
